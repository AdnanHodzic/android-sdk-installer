Linux utility which aims to automatically install and configure Android SDK and Eclipse ADT Plugin; adds hardware support for devices; and enables full MTP support.

Scope and goal of this project is explained as part of my University Capstone project: [Adnan Hodzic - Implementation of Android SDK into Debian Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/foolcontrol-media/2020/08/ImplementationofAndroidSDKintoDebianLinux.pdf)
